The UTSW BioHPC Singularity Registry is a private registry hosted by the BioHPC high performance computing group at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, TX. This registry is private as it holds images customized for BioHPC systems, which may incorporate licensed software restricted to UTSW staff and students.
